<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Steam Sterilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>SFPP</li><li>Pre-Vac</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small steam sterilizers are commonly used in medical facilities to kill harmful microorganisms on medical equipment. There are three main types of small steam sterilizers: Gravity, SFPP (steam flush pressure pulse), and Pre-Vac (pre-vacuum). </p><p>Gravity sterilizers rely on gravity to remove air from the chamber before sterilization. SFPP sterilizers use a combination of steam and pressure pulses to better penetrate and sterilize complex instruments. Pre-Vac sterilizers remove air through a series of vacuum cycles before introducing steam for sterilization, ensuring a more effective and thorough sterilization process.</p></p>
