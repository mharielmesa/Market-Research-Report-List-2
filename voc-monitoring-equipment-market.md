<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) monitoring equipment includes two main types: Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor sensors. PIDs use ultraviolet light to ionize VOCs, while Metal-Oxide Semiconductor sensors rely on a chemical reaction to detect VOCs. PIDs are more sensitive and versatile, suitable for a wide range of applications. On the other hand, Metal-Oxide Semiconductor sensors are more cost-effective and commonly used in industrial settings. Both types play a vital role in monitoring and controlling VOC emissions for environmental and health safety.</p></p>
