<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li><li>Non-contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The capacitive liquid level sensor market is divided into two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact capacitive liquid level sensors require direct contact with the liquid to measure its level, making them suitable for smaller tanks or containers. On the other hand, non-contact capacitive liquid level sensors do not need to touch the liquid and instead rely on changes in capacitance to measure levels, making them ideal for larger tanks or hazardous materials. Both types offer accurate and reliable level measurements for various industrial applications.</p></p>
