<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV-reduced Adhesive Tapes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided</li><li>Double-sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV-reduced adhesive tapes are available in two main types: single-sided and double-sided. Single-sided tapes have adhesive on only one side, allowing them to stick to a surface on one side while remaining non-adhesive on the other. Double-sided tapes have adhesive on both sides, allowing them to bond two surfaces together. Both types of tapes are designed to have reduced sensitivity to UV light, making them ideal for outdoor or high-exposure applications where traditional adhesive tapes may degrade or lose effectiveness.</p></p>
