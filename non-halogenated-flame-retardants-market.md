<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Halogenated Flame Retardants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Phosphorous Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-halogenated flame retardants are used to reduce the flammability of materials. Two common types in the market are aluminum hydroxide and phosphorous-based flame retardants. Aluminum hydroxide works by releasing water vapor when exposed to heat, cooling the material and inhibiting combustion. Phosphorous-based retardants work by disrupting the combustion process through the release of free radicals. Both types are considered environmentally friendly alternatives to halogenated flame retardants, which have been associated with health and environmental concerns.</p></p>
