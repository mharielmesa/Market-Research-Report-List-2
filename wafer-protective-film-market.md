<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Protective Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV Curing Type</li><li>Non-UV Curing Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wafer protective films are used in the semiconductor industry to protect wafers during the manufacturing process. The UV curing type of protective film requires exposure to ultraviolet light to cure and form a strong bond, while the non-UV curing type does not require this additional step. Both types provide protection against scratches, contaminants, and damage during handling and processing. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements of the manufacturing process and the desired level of protection for the wafers.</p></p>
