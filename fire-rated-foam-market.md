<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Rated Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flammability</li><li>Normal Flammability</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire Rated Foam is categorized into two main types based on flammability levels. Low Flammability foam is designed to have reduced flammability properties, making it ideal for applications where fire safety is a critical concern. On the other hand, Normal Flammability foam is more combustible and is suitable for less hazardous environments. Both types of foam provide insulation and protection, but Low Flammability foam offers an added level of fire resistance for increased safety measures.</p></p>
