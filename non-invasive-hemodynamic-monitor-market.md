<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Hemodynamic Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuously</li><li>Non-continuous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive hemodynamic monitor market can be categorized into two main types: continuous and non-continuous. Continuously monitoring devices provide real-time measurements of a patient's hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure and heart rate, without interruption. On the other hand, non-continuous monitors capture hemodynamic data at specific intervals or points in time. Both types of monitors play a crucial role in providing healthcare professionals with valuable information about a patient's cardiovascular status, aiding in diagnosis and treatment decisions.</p></p>
