<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Corrosion Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Paints</li><li>Solvent-Based Paints</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-corrosion paints are categorized into two main types: Water-based paints and solvent-based paints. Water-based paints are environmentally friendly and have lower volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions compared to solvent-based paints. They are easy to clean up and have a faster drying time. On the other hand, solvent-based paints offer better adhesion and durability, making them suitable for harsh environments. However, they come with higher VOC emissions and longer drying times. Both types of paints provide protection against corrosion and extend the lifespan of metal surfaces.</p></p>
