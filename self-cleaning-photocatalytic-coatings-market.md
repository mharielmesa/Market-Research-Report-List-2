<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Photocatalytic Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homogeneous Photocatalysis</li><li>Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning photocatalytic coatings are divided into two main types: homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis. Homogeneous photocatalysis involves a single phase where both the photocatalyst and the substrate are in the same medium. Heterogeneous photocatalysis, on the other hand, involves two phases where the photocatalyst is separated from the substrate. Each type has its own advantages and applications, with homogeneous photocatalysis offering improved efficiency and selectivity, while heterogeneous photocatalysis provides better versatility and ease of separation for reuse.</p></p>
