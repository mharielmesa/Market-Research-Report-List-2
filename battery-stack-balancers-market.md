<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Stack Balancers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Balancing Systems</li><li>Passive Balanced Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active balancing systems use external circuitry to actively redistribute energy among the battery cells to ensure all cells are charged and discharged evenly. This type of balancer is more complex and expensive but provides more precise balancing. On the other hand, passive balancing systems rely on passive components such as resistors to dissipate excess energy from overcharged cells. This type of balancer is simpler and more cost-effective but may be less efficient in balancing all cells.</p></p>
